# Homework

You will create a virtual “ViewMaster” viewer in this homework assignment. I challenge you to find imagery and art that defines and describes social justice worldwide. It should contain not only the image but also the name of the photograph, a short description, the author of the image, and the date taken.

You will create a single class and multiple objects from this class. A new image, title, description, author, and year should appear each time the button is pressed.

You should store all your objects in an array and pick a random object from your collection to display.

Whew! That sounds like a lot. Let’s break it down.

## Technical Specs

1. Create a single class
2. Create at least five different objects from that class with the following properties:
   1. Title
   2. Image
   3. Description
   4. Author
   5. Image Year - make it up if you don't know
3. Store each object in a single array.
4. Have a button on the page.
5. Pressing the button should randomly display an object from the array.
