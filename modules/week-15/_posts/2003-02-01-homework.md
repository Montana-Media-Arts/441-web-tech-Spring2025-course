# Homework

In this homework, it should feel a little similar to three.js, but this time you are going to create a simple Babylon project.  Create shapes, have them rotate, add one of your models.  Be creative and have fun if you want to build off another project that is okay too.

1. Have at least five shapes on your first page.
2. Create a second page with a 3D model you created or found online.
3. Have the shapes/models rotating around by touch/mouse or independently.
4. Upload everything to your GitHub repository and turn your link into Moodle.
5. Have fun with this!
