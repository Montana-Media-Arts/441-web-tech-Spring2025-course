# Overview

## Babylon.js Game Engine

We are going to explore a new 3D library called Babylon.  It's quite extensive so we will just scratch the surface. Their documentation is really good, so we will start with that and hopefully that will get you going.

As per their documentation:

We know that each person comes to Babylon.js with their own individual background, experiences, and learning style. We also understand that each one of you has a different goal in mind for your learning journey. We have done our best to organize these doc pages to help the largest number of people achieve their learning goals as efficiently as possible. With two parts to our whole documentation – knowing that many of you want to dive right into Babylon.js, learning about the engine and its features, while others of you prefer to start by understanding how to get Babylon.js set up and integrated into a web application – you'll find paths optimized for each of these learning styles in the coming pages.
