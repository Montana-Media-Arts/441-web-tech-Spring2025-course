# Homework

This week, you will create a short "choose your own adventure story" on a single page.  You will use JavaScript to make choices, access the DOM, and print something out.  It should have a title, the story, and at least the three progressions in the story.  Please add images, colors, fonts, etc., via CSS to set the scene.

Specifics:

1. Use if statements
2. Use variables
3. Use function(s)
4. Use addition or concatenation
5. Have at least three choices in your story
6. Include images, colors, and fonts to your story via an external CSS sheet
7. Each choice should update something in the DOM. 
9. Use ChatGPT, CoPilot, or Gemini to recreate the homework assignment. Reflect on its creation.  What did you like? What didn't you like?
10. Please include a **ReadMe** that discusses your successes, challenges, and how you overcame them.

You will need to use the onclick event to change the DOM using a button.  Here is a resource to help. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onclick.asp" target="_blank">onclick</a>

Please save your work and upload it to your repository. You will continue working on this next week.
