# Homework

In this assignment, you are going to create some art! You will set up your page with shapes, text, and images. You are doing to have the imagery fade in and fade out. You will move the shapes, images, and text around. Your piece must switch between different images, text, and shapes. This switching will require arrays, which I know you love!

Technical specifications:

1. Create a page that uses jQuery. You can either have it locally or use a CDN.
2. Add images that fade in and out and have them move.
3. Switch between different images each time an image fades out.
4. Add text onto the screen and have them move. It can be quotes, words of wisdom, or just words.
5. Switch through different words as well after a specific time.
6. Add different shapes and have them move around the screen.
7. Switch shapes after a specific time.
