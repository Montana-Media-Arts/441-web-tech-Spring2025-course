# Homework

In this assignment, you are going to create some art! You will set up your page with shapes, text, and images. You are doing to have the imagery fade in and fade out. You will move the shapes around, and the text will increase and decrease in size. Your piece must rotate between different images, text, and shapes. This rotation will require using arrays, which I know you love!

Technical specifications:

Create a page that uses jQuery. You can either have it locally or use a CDN.
Add images that fade in and out.
Rotate between different images each time an image fades out.
Add text onto the screen. It can be quotes, words of wisdom, or just words.
You should rotate through different words as well after a specific time.
You will have different shapes that move around the screen, too.
These shapes should move for a specific time, then fade out, and a different image should appear.
