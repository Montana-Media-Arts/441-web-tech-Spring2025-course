## Conclusions

That is it for Week 1. I hope you are excited for this course and everything we are going to learn this semester.

Remember, if you need help, feel free to reach out using one of our various modes of communication.

## Study Groups

Another strategy I would suggest you adopt, regardless of whether you need help right now, is to form a study/work group for this class. Consider reaching out to your fellow classmates. You could do this through the Issues Forum or Discord.

## Date Information

Please keep track of the due dates in Canvas.
